# Warframe Mastery Tracker

https://bandildo.github.io/warframe_mr/

Mobile friendly webpage which helps track which Warframe items have been acquired 🛠️ and which have been mastered 👑

- quickly see which weapons are easy to acquire and master (e.g. purchased in the Market)
- quickly see if it is okay to sell a mastered weapon (e.g. not an ingredient to another weapon, and easy to acquire)
- mobile friendly for a quick update while you are playing
